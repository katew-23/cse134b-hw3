            <h2>My role in the project:</h2>
            <div class="proj-desc">
                <p>
                    For my project Memori, I developed a cross-platform mobile application using React Native and 
                    Expo to let users create and share photo and video albums with built-in journaling and a calendar view. 
                    I implemented core features such as album creation, media upload, and user authentication, connecting the 
                    front end to a real-time backend. I also designed the navigation flow and optimized the layout for 
                    responsive performance across iOS and Android devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond front-end development, I structured the data models to efficiently store user albums, 
                    metadata, and media references while maintaining synchronization across users' shared albums. 
                    I focused on building modular and reusable components to streamline future development and 
                    improve scalability. Working in an agile environment, I translated product ideas into concrete 
                    implementation tasks, conducted regular testing, and refined UI elements based on feedback to 
                    enhance usability. Through Memori, I gained hands-on experience with full-stack mobile development, 
                    UI design, and cloud-based data management.

            <h2>What I learned:</h2>
            <div class="proj-desc">
                <p>
                    Through Memori, I learned how to take a product from concept to deployment while balancing both 
                    technical implementation and user experience design. Building the app from scratch taught me how 
                    to integrate front-end components with real-time backend services, handle asynchronous data flows, 
                    and manage state effectively in React Native. I became more comfortable debugging complex issues 
                    related to authentication, media rendering, and data synchronization, which strengthened my 
                    problem-solving and debugging skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with a small team in an agile development cycle also taught me the importance of clear 
                    communication, version control, and iteration. I learned how to break down large goals into 
                    achievable sprint tasks, gather feedback, and refine features for better usability. Most importantly, 
                    the project gave me a deeper appreciation for how technical design decisions impact user experience--
                    how small details in data structure, performance, and interface design can make an app feel more 
                    seamless, personal, and meaningful to its users.
